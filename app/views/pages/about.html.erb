<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> After serving in the United States Army for 8 years, I knew I needed to further my education, skill and experience. With no devolpment skills other than pre-formatted layouts and social media marketing, I took the plunge and went to school to become a developer; both front end and back end. Here I am today, a Father, a Veteran and a Developer. </p>
